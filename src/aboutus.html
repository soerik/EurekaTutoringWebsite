        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
            We believe the right teacher plays an integral part in a child's learning
            and development. They can not only educate, but have the ability to foster 
            a love for learning that will last a lifetime. Oftentimes students get 
            bogged down in formulas and memorization and miss the magic that learning 
            can be. We aim to curate fun and engaging lessons with real-world applications 
            to capture the attention of students. We not only want to improve your child’s 
            academic performance but also spark their curiosity and imagination, which 
            will motivate them well into their educational journey! <br /><br />We also understand that 
            each student learns in their own way, which is why each session will be curated 
            to your child’s specific needs. Instead of one teacher teaching concepts the 
            same way and speed to 30 unique students, our personalized, one-on-one approach 
            ensures your child will learn in the most efficient way possible! Whether your 
            child is falling behind, or lacks an academic challenge, both can be extremely 
            detrimental to a student’s motivation and passion for learning. This is why we 
            promise to always challenge our students to be their best selves and create an 
            individualized plan that ensures they learn in a way that works for them.
