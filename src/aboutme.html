    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m Erik, founder and owner of Eureka Tutoring! 
        I am currently a 2nd year student at McMaster 
        University studying Software Engineering & 
        Neuroscience. Ever since I was a little kid 
        I’ve had a passion for learning and an even 
        bigger love for sharing what I learn with 
        others. I was extremely privileged to have 
        teachers throughout my childhood who excited
        and challenged me through their teaching, 
        and my goal is to foster that same love for
        learning in the next generation of students.
        Throughout my time teaching both math and
        swimming I have worked with hundreds of 
        students of various ages and backgrounds, 
        and I understand that every kid is different,
        each with their own preferred learning styles 
        and needs. I personally assure that I will do 
        everything I can to not only improve your 
        child's academic performance but also help 
        cultivate a passion for learning that will 
        carry them through their academic journey 
        and beyond!</p>
