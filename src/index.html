            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>
                We believe the right teacher plays an integral part in a child's learning
                and development. They can not only educate but have the ability to foster 
                a love for learning that will last a lifetime. Oftentimes students get 
                bogged down in formulas and memorization and miss the magic that learning 
                can be. We aim to curate fun and engaging lessons with real-world applications 
                to capture the attention of students. We not only want to improve your child’s 
                academic performance but also spark their curiosity and imagination, which 
                will motivate them well into their educational journey! <br /><br />We also understand that 
                each student learns in their own way, which is why each session will be curated 
                to your child’s specific needs. Instead of one teacher teaching concepts the 
                same way and speed to 30 unique students, our personalized, one-on-one approach 
                ensures your child will learn in the most efficient way possible! Whether your 
                child is falling behind, or lacks an academic challenge, both can be extremely 
                detrimental to a student’s motivation and passion for learning. This is why we 
                promise to always challenge our students to be their best selves and create an 
                individualized plan that ensures they learn in a way that works for them.
